# SS (SimpleScript)
Just a simple programming language / experiment to build a simpler and less quirky JavaScript.  

> SimpleScript is a Statically Typed, Application programming language inspired by JavaScript/TypeScript and Go, to target multiple execution methods from AOT compilation for binary executables to popular VM platforms (like JVM / BEAM / WASM) to interpretation and JIT compilation techniques.

Here are its core tenets:
1. Simple
2. Simple to Understand --> Intuitive code with no assumptions or quirkiness (WYSIWYG)
3. Simple to Write --> Intuitive semantics without requiring any hackery (WYSIWYG)


## Language design goals
- Read more about the language's spec and design goals in the [specs](./spec.md)
- See the [syntatic grammar definition in BNF](./syntatic%20grammar.bnf)

Generally:
- readability (and in extension, familiarity)
- ease of use (easy and intuitive constructs/syntax)
- no stupid module issues like python
- typed language
- high level language
- memory model
    - either with a gc
    - or something like rust's memory tracking model
- dun be too verbose
- dun be toooo abstract, can support abstract ideas like meta programming, but not too extreme to support less verbosity


## Goals / Milestones
- Stuff to run the language
    - Intepreter implmentation in Rust and JavaScript
    - Rust compiler frontend, hooking up to LLVM
    - Transpilation to JavaScript to run in the web
    - Perhaps a JVM version?
- Others
    - VS code and vim extensions!
