# sle (Simple Language Experiment)
Just a simple language experiment.

## Language design goals
- readability (and in extension, familiarity)
- ease of use (easy and intuitive constructs/syntax)
- no stupid module issues like python
- typed language
- high level language
- memory model
    - either with a gc
    - or something like rust's memory tracking model
- dun be too verbose
- dun be toooo abstract, can support abstract ideas like meta programming, but not too extreme to support less verbosity
