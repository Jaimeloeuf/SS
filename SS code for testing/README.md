# SS code for testing
This subrepo contains some SimpleScript code that will be used to test the runtime semantics of the different implementations to ensure that they are working as intended.

Note that there is still no way of doing automated semantic testing, other than simply running the code using the desired implementation and seeing if it works as intended..
