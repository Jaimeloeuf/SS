# Rust interpreter
NOTE: This is not the final interpreter for SS.

This folder contains a Rust interpreter for a modified version of the lox language inspired by [rlox](https://github.com/julioolvr/rlox).  
Doing this to learn about interpreters, and how to build one for a dynamically typed language, which will be used to build the actual interpreter for SS later on.

<!-- @todo add instructions on how to run -->
